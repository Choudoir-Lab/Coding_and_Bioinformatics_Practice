## Miniconda

<br>

__Description__

---

Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others). If you need more packages, use the conda install command to install from thousands of packages available by default in Anacondaâ€™s public repo, or from other channels, like conda-forge or bioconda. From the Anaconda documentation (https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install).

This allows for control over which packages are installed.
